# Non-destructive Testing Controller and Monitoring

## Description
This project using Arduino Mega 2560, Board Ramps 1.4, Stepper Motor Hessai 17HS4401, Driver Motor AM4988, Osciloscope Hante 6022BE, Eddy Current Sensor, Low Pass Filter, Op Amp, Signal Generator, Mechanical Printer 3D Prusa i3, Dual Switching Power Supply For controlling and monitoring this project, you can use visual basic 6.0 program from the link shown on top. <br>
You can use this project to controll and monitoring NDT process on your computer to visualize crack on metal obect.

## How to use
1. Upload arduino code to arduino mega on board ramps 1.4
2. Run Visual Basic 6.0 code on your computer
3. Connect hantek osciloscope to your computer
4. Connect arduino mega to your computer
5. Supply NDT sensor to mini function generator
6. Done, now you can controll and monitoring NDT process
